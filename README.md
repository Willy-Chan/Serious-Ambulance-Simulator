# Project_Name - BWSI SGAI Team CW1 (The half-competent Gits)

This modification of the BWSI SGAI Grid-world Ambulance project aims to assess the statistical consequences that differing moral policies can have on human and machine operators in a zombie apocalypse simulation. This simulation is intended to aid legislators and social policy-makers in understanding how differing moral codes can affect ambulance simulation gameplay to both implement better informed policies based on observed ethical behavior.


## Grid-World Ambulance Game Mod Overview

Goal:
- Maximize total score at the end of your final turn via a set point system based on differing hierarchies of attributes (Rich/Poor, Male/Female, Young/Old). 
- Points are gained by running into zombies and bringing injured agents to hospital tiles. 
- Points can be lost by running over pedestrians or standing on lava tiles. 

Rules: 
- Game turns “end” when the player runs out of energy.
- 1 energy point is spent in every instance of standing still, rotating 90°, or moving forward.
- Energy can be gained by picking up battery tiles or traveling through mud tiles.
